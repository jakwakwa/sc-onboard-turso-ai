## Overview

The Control Tower API provides programmatic access to the onboarding workflow, allowing you to manage applicants, quotes, documents, and risk assessments.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```bash
/api
```

## Authentication

Currently, most internal API routes rely on session-based authentication via Clerk or internal headers for service-to-service communication.

## Response Format

Responses are generally returned in JSON format.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## Error Handling

Errors are returned with an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON object containing the error details.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message description"
}
```
