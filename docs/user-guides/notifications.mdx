## Where notifications appear

Notifications are available from the bell icon in the top bar. The badge count indicates unread items.

## Notification types

- **Awaiting**: human input required for a workflow step
- **Completed**: a workflow or stage finished successfully
- **Failed**: a workflow ended with an error
- **Timeout**: no response received within the allotted time
- **Paused**: workflow waiting for intervention
- **Error**: system error that needs attention

## Actions you can take

Some notifications include quick actions:

- **Approve / Reject** for items awaiting human input
- **Retry / Cancel** for timeout, paused, or error cases

Actions are recorded and sent to the workflow engine immediately.

## Marking notifications as read

Use **Mark all read** to clear the unread badge. This does not remove notifications, it only marks them as read.

## Opening a workflow from a notification

Select a notification to open the related workflow. Use this to:

- Review the current stage and status
- Inspect the activity timeline
- Resolve errors or complete approvals

## Best practices

- Prioritise **Awaiting** and **Timeout** items to keep workflows moving
- Review **Error** notifications before retrying or cancelling
- Record decisions consistently for audit purposes
