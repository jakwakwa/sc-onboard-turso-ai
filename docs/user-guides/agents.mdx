## What agents do

Agents are autonomous AI services or system workers that handle specialised tasks in the onboarding workflow.

### Active Agents (Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**)

- **Risk Verification Agent**: Analyzes bank statements and accountant letters to assess FICA compliance and risk.
- **Quote Generator Agent**: Generates risk-adjusted pricing quotes based on applicant profiles and credit scores.

### Planned Agents

The following agents are currently in development or planned for future releases:

- **Document Generator**: For legal agreements.
- **E-Signature Handler**: For managing DocuSign workflows.
- **V24/V27 Sync**: For legacy system data synchronization.
- **Notification Handler**: For multi-channel alerts.

## Agent dashboard

The **Agents** page serves as a control tower for your AI fleet, providing **real-time insights** directly from the database:

- **Total agents**: The complete registry of available and planned agents.
- **Active agents**: Agents currently processing live workflows.
- **Total callbacks**: The number of successful operations performed by agents (e.g., successful risk assessments).
- **Errors**: The number of failed operations or exceptions logged by agents.

> **Note**: Statistics are aggregated in real-time. "Callbacks" track successful `agent_callback` or task completion events, while "Errors" track logged workflow exceptions.

## Agent status cards

Each agent card displays:

- **Identity**: Agent Name and ID (e.g., `xt_risk_agent_v2`).
- **AI Model**: The specific AI model powering the agent (e.g., **Gemini 3 Flash**).
- **Status**:
    - **Active**: Operational and processing tasks.
    - **Inactive / Planned**: Not yet deployed or currently disabled.
    - **Error**: Experiencing critical failures.
- **Performance**:
    - **Last callback**: Timestamp of the most recent activity.
    - **Callbacks**: Total successful runs.
    - **Errors**: Total failed runs.

## Interpreting agent status

- **Active**: The agent is healthy, configured with a valid provider (e.g., Google Cloud Vertex AI), and successfully processing events.
- **Inactive**: The agent is a placeholder or has been manually disabled.
- **Error**: The agent has reported repeated failures. Check the specific error count for severity.

## When to escalate

Escalate to engineering or operations if:

- An active agent (like Risk or Quote) shows a sudden spike in **Errors**.
- The **Last callback** time is significantly older than expected for a high-volume workflow.
- Critical agents stuck in **Error** state are blocking new applications.
