## What agents do

Agents are external services that handle specialised tasks such as:

- Document generation
- Electronic signatures
- Risk verification
- Data synchronisation
- Notifications and escalation

## Agent dashboard

The **Agents** page shows a high-level summary of the fleet:

- **Total agents**
- **Active agents**
- **Total callbacks**
- **Errors**

## Agent status cards

Each agent card displays:

- **Agent ID and name**
- **Task type**
- **Status**: active, inactive, or error
- **Last callback time**
- **Callback and error counts**

## Interpreting agent status

- **Active**: agent is operational and receiving requests
- **Inactive**: agent is temporarily offline or disabled
- **Error**: agent reported repeated failures or a critical issue

## When to escalate

Escalate to engineering or operations if:

- An agent stays in **Error** state for multiple hours
- A workflow remains stuck with the same agent
- Errors increase sharply without a clear external cause
