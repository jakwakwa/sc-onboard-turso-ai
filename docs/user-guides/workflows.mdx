## Workflow list

Open **Workflows** from the sidebar to see all active and completed workflows.

### What you can do

- Sort by client, status, agent, or start time
- View a workflow’s detail page
- Open the workflow payload for deeper inspection
- Approve or reject workflows awaiting human input

## Workflow stages

Each workflow moves through four stages:

1. **Applicant Capture**: intake and initial record creation
2. **Quotation**: agreement and service configuration
3. **Verification**: bank assessment and FICA document checks
4. **Integration**: handover and operational readiness

## Workflow statuses

Status badges appear in the list and on each workflow:

- **Pending**: queued and not yet started
- **In progress**: actively processing
- **Awaiting human**: waiting for an approval or manual decision
- **Completed**: all stages finished successfully
- **Failed**: processing ended with an error
- **Timeout**: waiting for input exceeded the time limit
- **Paused**: stopped pending intervention

## Human-in-the-loop actions

When a workflow status is **Awaiting human**, quick actions appear:

- **Approve**: move the workflow to the next stage
- **Reject**: stop the workflow and record a decision

You will be prompted to confirm the action before it is sent.

## Workflow details page

Select **View workflow** from the actions menu to open the detail view.

### Key sections

- **Header**: workflow ID, client, status, and stage
- **Generated quote**: amount, status, and rationale (when available)
- **Activity timeline**: audit log of all events and transitions
- **Client details**: company and contact information
- **Processing status**: current agent and any error details

## Payload viewer

Use **View payload** to open the raw workflow payload. This is useful for:

- Debugging unexpected behaviour
- Verifying data passed between stages
- Supporting escalation and compliance reviews
