## Forms hub

Each workflow has a dedicated forms hub that shows required forms and progress.

You will see:

- **Form status** for each document
- **Progress** (step count and completion percentage)
- **Stage** where the form belongs

If you do not have a direct link, ask your administrator for the workflow’s forms hub URL.

## Form statuses

- **Not started**: form has not been opened
- **In progress**: draft saved, not submitted

## Working through a form

All forms use a step-by-step wizard:

1. Complete the current step
2. Select **Next** to continue
3. Use **Save draft** to store progress without submitting
