## When to create a lead

Create a lead as soon as you have a qualified prospect and enough contact details to begin onboarding. A lead is the entry point for every workflow.

## Create a new lead

1. Go to **Leads** in the sidebar.
2. Select **New Lead**.
3. Complete the required fields and save.

### Required fields

- **Company name**
- **Contact name**
- **Email address**

### Optional fields

- Industry
- Employee count
- Estimated monthly volume
- Phone number
- Notes

## Lead statuses

Leads are grouped by their current status:

- **New**: just created and not yet contacted
- **Contacted**: initial contact made
- **Qualified**: verified as a strong fit
- **Proposal**: in proposal or quote preparation
- **Negotiation**: terms under discussion
- **Won**: converted to an active client
- **Lost**: discontinued or declined

Use the pipeline tiles at the top of the Leads page to quickly see counts per status.

## Leads list

The table includes all leads and their current status. Use it to:

- Review key client details
- Track progress through the pipeline
- Identify stalled or overdue leads

## Tips for clean lead data

- Use a consistent company name format (registered name preferred)
- Capture the primary decision-maker in **Contact name**
- Add context in **Notes** to help later workflow steps
