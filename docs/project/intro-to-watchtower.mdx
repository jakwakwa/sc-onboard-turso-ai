### Step 1: Set up your local environment

  <Accordion title="Clone your docs locally" icon="copy">
    The system has recently transitioned from a Zapier-dependent architecture to a direct event-driven model. This shift centralises state management within [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) workflows, eliminates external dependencies for core logic, and enables direct communication between capture sources (Google Forms/Apps Script) and the Next.js backend.

  <Accordion title="Start the preview server" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    1. Install the Control Tower Onboard CLI: `bun i -g mint` 2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`

  - **Zero-Middleware Architecture**: Direct ingestion of webhooks from Google Apps Script, removing Zapier entirely to reduce latency and costs.
  - **Event-Driven Workflows**: Complex business logic (onboarding, verification, signing) is orchestrated via Inngest, with clear domain events like `onboarding/lead.created` and `contract/signed`.
  - **Deterministic Verification**: Replaces probabilistic AI voting with a strict, hierarchical veto system using a local blocklist (`mock_blacklist.json`).
  - **Direct Lead Capture**: Secure HTTP endpoints (`/api/webhooks/lead-capture`) handle form submissions directly.
  - **Real-time Dashboard**: A comprehensive
